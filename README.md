Go to desired folder directory to work on the code, git bash there, and run the following commands

```
```sh
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/sodrin/CS321-004.git
```

Switch to your production branch
```sh
git checkout "PROD_NAME_HERE"
```
(this will update the current folder with the files from your current branch)
(make the necessary changes you want)

When you're ready to commit and push changes, do the following
```sh
git commit -am "commit message"
```
```sh
git push
```

If you want to merge your changes to the master branch, you can switch to it and merge like this
```sh
git checkout master
```
```sh
git merge "branchtomergename"
```
